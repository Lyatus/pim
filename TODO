UI/UX:
- Have an actual structure 
- Conversations in panes
- Have a landing page if not logged (with tutorial)
- Multilingual support
- Allow refusing conversations
- Support sending raw image data (e.g. from screenshots)
Client:
- Delta compression for shared info
- Allow peer-to-peer signaling (with more priority than servers)
- Group chats
- Use login/pass combination to generate private then public key (allows authentification on multiple devices)
- Implement a DHT (maybe Kademlia), it should be persistent-storage-oriented
- Store user information as encrypted blob in DHT (allows fetching user information on multiple devices)
Server:
- Server should also serve the client files (avoid http server setup for server creators)
- Server setup script could deal with letsencrypt configuration
