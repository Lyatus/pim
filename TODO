- Maybe a UI that doesn't suck ass
- Delta compression for shared info
- Allow peer-to-peer signaling (with more priority than servers)
- Group chats
- Don't use ICE candidate after successful connection (or find good way to differentiate between wanted and unwanted)
- Gather all ICE candidates before sending them (maybe even bundle them with the offer/answer?)
